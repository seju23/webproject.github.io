<h1>Religions of the World</h1>
<p><img src="123.jpg" width="320" height="163" align="right" />A religion is a set of beliefs that is held by a group of people. There are many different religions, each with a different set of beliefs. The beliefs are about the world and the people in it, about how they came into being, and what their purpose is. </p>
<p>Each religion usually has their own type of &quot;devotions&quot; when people worship or pray. They often have religious &quot;rituals&quot; (special things that are always done in the same way) for certain times of the year or certain times of a person's life. Other words that are used for &quot;religion&quot; are &quot;faith&quot; and &quot;belief system&quot;.</p>
